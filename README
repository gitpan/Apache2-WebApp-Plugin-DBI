NAME
    Apache2::WebApp::Plugin::DBI - Database interface wrapper

SYNOPSIS
      my $obj = $c->plugin('DBI')->method( ... );     # Apache2::WebApp::Plugin::DBI->method()

        or

      $c->plugin('DBI')->method( ... );

DESCRIPTION
    A database independent interface that gives your application universal
    support across many databases including MySQL, PostGRe, and Oracle. Also
    supports many common flat file formats.

PREREQUISITES
    This package is part of a larger distribution and was NOT intended to be
    used directly. In order for this plugin to work properly, the following
    packages must be installed:

      Apache2::WebApp
      Apache::DBI
      DBI
      Params::Validate

INSTALLATION
    From source:

      $ tar xfz Apache2-WebApp-Plugin-DBI-0.X.X.tar.gz
      $ perl MakeFile.PL PREFIX=~/path/to/custom/dir LIB=~/path/to/custom/lib
      $ make
      $ make test
      $ make install

    Perl one liner using CPAN.pm:

      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Apache2::WebApp::Plugin::DBI'

    Use of CPAN.pm in interactive mode:

      $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
      cpan> install Apache2::WebApp::Plugin::DBI
      cpan> quit

    Just like the manual installation of Perl modules, the user may need
    root access during this process to insure write permission is allowed
    within the installation directory.

CONFIGURATION
    Unless it already exists, add the following to your projects
    *webapp.conf*

      [database]
      driver      = mysql
      host        = localhost
      name        = database
      user        = foo
      password    = bar
      auto_commit = 0

OBJECT METHODS
  connect
    Make a new database connection.

      my $dbh = $c->plugin('DBH')->connect({
          driver    => 'mysql',
          host      => 'localhost',
          name      => 'database',
          user      => 'bar',
          password  => 'baz',
          commit    => 1 || 0,
        });

      my $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FR..");
